### What is it?   
---
**Path Planner** is a graphical user interface to design the sightseeing routes for tourists. 
After some basic settings like your `current location` and `travel preferences`, 
you will see our **designed route** in **blue line** and **suggested attractions** in **blue pins** shown in the real map.  
We believe our plan would match you perfectly based on our sufficient data fetched from **Tripadvisor** and we have prepared top `71` attractions in New York City which can definitly meet all your travel needs!
